    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My one true love is non-perturbative physics, and as such my research interests
      span a wide range of topics within particle theory, including thermal field
      theory, false vacuum decay + phase transitions, QCD + collider phenomenology,
      and baryogenesis.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Non-perturbative Methods for False Vacuum Decay <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10687">[arXiv:2104.10687]</a>
    </h3>

      Abstract: We propose a simple non-perturbative formalism for false vacuum
      decay using functional methods. We introduce the quasi-stationary effective
      action, a bounce action that non-perturbatively incorporates radiative corrections
      and is robust to strong couplings. The quasi-stationary effective action
      obeys an exact flow equation in a modified functional renormalization group
      with a motivated regulator functional. We demonstrate the use of this formalism
      in a simple toy model and compare our result with that obtained in perturbation
      theory.

      Asymmetric Matters from a Dark First-Order Phase Transition <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12342">[arXiv:1911.12342]</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      with Thomas Konstandin, Robert McGehee, and Hitoshi Murayama
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: We introduce a model for matters-genesis in which both the baryonic
      and dark matter asymmetries originate from a first-order phase transition in
      a dark sector with an SU(3)&times;SU(2)&times;U(1) gauge group and minimal matter content.
      In the simplest scenario, we predict that dark matter is a dark neutron with
      mass either mn=1.33 GeV or mn=1.58 GeV. Alternatively, dark matter may be
      comprised of equal numbers of dark protons and pions. This model, in either
      scenario, is highly discoverable through both dark matter direct detection
      and dark photon search experiments. The strong dark matter self interactions
      may ameliorate small-scale structure problems, while the strongly first-order
      phase transition may be confirmed at future gravitational wave observatories.

      Baryogenesis From a Dark First-Order Phase Transition <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08068">[arXiv:1910.08068]</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      with Thomas Konstandin, Robert McGehee, Hitoshi Murayama, and G&eacute;raldine Servant
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: We present a very minimal model for baryogenesis by a dark first-order
      phase transition. It employs a new dark SU(2)D gauge group with two doublet
      Higgs bosons, two lepton doublets, and two singlets. The singlets act as a
      neutrino portal that transfer the generated asymmetry to the Standard Model.
      The model predicts exotic decays of the Higgs and Z bosons, &Delta;Neff = 0.09-0.13,
      and stochastic gravitational waves, all detectable by future experiments.

      Photon Isolation and Jet Substucture <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11622">[arXiv:1805.11622]</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      with Jesse Thaler
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: We introduce soft drop isolation, a new photon isolation criterion inspired
      by jet substructure techniques. Soft drop isolation is collinear safe and is
      equivalent to Frixione isolation at leading non-trivial order in the small R
      limit. However, soft drop isolation has the interesting feature of being democratic,
      meaning that photons can be treated equivalently to hadrons for initial jet clustering.
      Taking advantage of this democratic property, we define an isolated photon subjet:
      a photon that is not isolated from its parent jet but is isolated within its parent
      subjet after soft drop declustering. The kinematics of this isolated photon subjet can
      be used to expose the QED splitting function, in which a quark radiates a photon,
      and we verify this behavior using both a parton shower generator and a perturbative
      calculation in the collinear limit.
